# FarmPulse
This is my FYP, FarmPulse.

This is a comprehensive app for farmers all across Ireland, allowing them to view , add, delete and monitor activity, inventorys and analyze costs through my website.

I have a deep interest in farming so this project appealed to me.

Hope you like it

Thanks 
Paddy
